# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application built with Flutter. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and search tasks. Users can also sort tasks by name, due date, or completion status. The app stores tasks locally using shared preferences, so they persist across app launches.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a name and due date.
- **Update Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
- **Search Tasks**: A search function allows users to find tasks by name or date.
- **Sort Tasks**: Tasks can be sorted by name, due date, or completion status.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved locally using shared preferences, so they are not lost when the app is closed.
